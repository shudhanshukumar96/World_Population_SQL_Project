In this Case study, I have taken the dataset from Rishav Sharma Kaggle’s dataset collection.

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/world-population?resource=download

Column names are follows below:

iso_code,country,2021_last_updated,2020_population,area,density_sq_km,growth_rate,world_%, and rank


Why I choose this project, Since Population keeps increasing day by day and it’s a concern for the society and environment
As the world’s population grows, so do its demands for water, land, trees, food, place, soil, etc — all of which come at a
high price for already endangered plants and animals.
